# falldown

:construction: **WIP** :construction:

Essentially a [Falldown!](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/falldown/id323493586) clone but as a [creative limitation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_limitation) the game is rendered entirely in browser console.

## Setup

```bash
yarn install
yarn start
```
